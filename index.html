            <h2>A co-founder at one of the world´s largest communities.</h2>
            <p>
              The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
              companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in
              not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
              largest communities teaching young minds about how to
              <span>sell</span> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole
              new world of opportunities.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="first-text">
            <p>
              As a developer, you have everything available to you and all
              that's holding you back is yourself.
            </p>
            <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
            <p>
              "How big would you dream, if you <span>knew</span> you wouldn't
              fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a
              developer, it's time to elevate your skilss and become a leader in
              something you're <span>passionate</span> about.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm happy yo chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
              company.
